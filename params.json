  "body": "`jump-or-exec` tries to see if an application is already running, and if so, bring the application's window to the front, otherwise launch an instance.\r\nBind it to a shortcut key and it will be useful!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```sh\r\njump-or-exec command [window_name]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nThis script is written in `sh`.\r\nYou just need to download `jump-or-exec.sh`, and put it into your `$PATH`,\r\nprobably after renaming to `jump-or-exec` and `chomd a+x`.\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\n\r\nThis script uses [wmctrl](http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/), which is a UNIX/Linux command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.\r\n\r\nThis script is based on the version in [eshock/.bashrc.d](https://github.com/eshock/.bashrc.d/blob/master/tools/jump-or-exec), in which `window_name` cannot be omitted.\r\n\r\nThere are also other scripts based on wmctrl, for example, [jumpapp](https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp) and [brocket](https://github.com/dmikalova/brocket).\r\nBoth are more complex^w feature rich.\r\nAnd I failed to make them work with some applications.\r\nThus I wrote this script.\r\n\r\nBesides wmctrl, it is also possible to implement `jump or exec` in Xlib directly.\r\nFor example, here is [a Python script](http://www.aifreedom.com/pluskid/JumpOrExec.html).\r\nThe script runs as a daemon, to avoid possible delays when invoking shell script and wmctrl.\r\nThe post is written in Chinese, but don't worry, you can read code in Python and code comments in English.\r\nOn my machine, `wmctrl` is fast enough.\r\nThus I consider I don't need a persistent daemon.\r\n",
